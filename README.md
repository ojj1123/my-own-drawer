# My Own Drawer

## Motivation

- It just sort of my study on `@use-gesture` and `@react-spring`.

- There are no drawer implementations that uses above libraries. In particular, it was difficult to find an implementation that had a feature like `snap points` other than [`vaul`](https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul).

- So I implement it to be a good reference.

## Features

- [ ] Controlled / UnControlled
- [ ] Unstyled (Using Radix's [`Dialog`](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dialog))
- [ ] Close when click overlay
- [ ] Prevent scroll when drawer open
- [x] Snap Points
